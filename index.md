We are delighted to be hosting the first JManc Unconference on 23rd June 2018 at Auto Trader.

## About JManc Unconference

This is the first ‘unconference’ run by the Manchester Java Community. We hope there to be many more to come.

The idea is that Java developers of all skill levels will to come together for a full day of discussions, sharing experiences, learning and spending time with our peers in the industry.

JManc is inspired by JCrete®, arguably the best Java unconference in the world.

## What is an unconference?

An unconference is a loosely structured, participant-driven meeting. It does not follow the traditional conference program structure. You decide what you want to talk about and which topics you want to discuss. The unconference starts with an empty schedule. No topics are mandated, no separations are made between “speakers” and “audience”. All participants work out a schedule by suggesting, planning, holding and evaluating sessions, collaboratively.

## What to expect

### Cost

We are providing the unconference to you free of charge. Please register for your free ticket [here](link).

All we ask is that if you register for a ticket you do indeed plan to attend. We are aware circumstances change so if you have registered but can no longer make it then please let us know.

### Location

Our wonderful sponsor, Auto Trader, have generously offered the event space in their wonderful offices at First Street to host our unconference. It’s a modern space and has many rooms and corners in which we can relax and have meaningful discussions and conversations. For more information about the location, please see the address section below.

### Food & Drink

Our amazing hosts, Auto Trader, will provide pastries when you arrive and lunch, as well as refreshments through the day.

Please let us know if you have any dietary requirements we need to cater for.

### Sessions

Unlike regular presentations, you won’t need slides, a laptop, or even a plan! It’s good for the person who submitted the session to spend the first few minutes talking about why they picked the topic and what they want to discuss. After that, everyone is a participant. You’re the speaker and the audience as we engage in meaningful discussion with the group. Being a part of the session is the best way to get the most out of your experience at the unconference.

### Submitting topics

Anyone can submit a session. If you do, you’re not expected to stand up for 35 minutes and talk to a crowd. That’s more like what you see at traditional conferences. Think about this more as you moderating a topic which others are keen to express an opinion or learn more about.
